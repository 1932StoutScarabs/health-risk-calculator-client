        <h2>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a crucial metric in assessing an individual's body weight in 
            relation to height, serving as a standardized screening tool for potential health 
            risks associated with underweight, overweight, and obesity. A high BMI is correlated 
            with an increased risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
            disease, and hypertension, whereas a low BMI may indicate malnutrition or underlying 
            medical conditions. Additionally, an individualâ€™s family medical history plays a 
            significant role in predisposition to weight-related health conditions, as genetic 
            factors influence metabolism, fat distribution, and the likelihood of developing 
            diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. Current blood pressure status further 
            contributes to the clinical significance of BMI, as elevated blood pressure often 
            coincides with increased body fat, particularly visceral adiposity, exacerbating 
            strain on the cardiovascular system and increasing the risk of stroke, heart 
            attack, and other complications.
